## Sarah – Tech Review Micro YouTuber (Primary & Only Persona)

### Profile
- **Segment:** 10K-100K subscribers (micro influencer)
- **Niche:** Tech review (gadgets, software, setup videos, "best of" lists)
- **Platform:** YouTube
- YouTube creator reviewing tech products: laptops, headphones, monitors, accessories, software
- Gets asked "What's that keyboard?" / "Which monitor is that?" in every video
- Earns from Amazon affiliate links
- Does everything herself — no editor, no assistant, no team

### Why This Segment?
- Tech reviewers are early adopters — open to new tools
- Micro segment does their own work (no assistant to delegate to)
- Amazon affiliate is already a natural part of their income
- Video descriptions are their main monetization channel

### Current Behavior
- Manually copies product links to video description
- Some links get affiliate codes, some don't (forgets)
- Spends 30-60 minutes per video on link management
- Uses messy text lists, no visual appeal
- International viewers click US links, sales lost

### Pain Points
1. **Time sink:** Finding every product, getting the right link, adding affiliate codes = hours of work
2. **Lost revenue:** Forgets products, forgets affiliate tags, wrong regional links
3. **Unprofessional look:** Raw Amazon links look ugly in descriptions
4. **No visibility:** Doesn't know which products get clicked

## Why Only One Persona?

curated.guide had 3 personas (Sarah, Mike, Alex). We learned:
- Multiple personas = diluted focus
- "Works for everyone" = works for no one
- Better to be perfect for one than mediocre for three

linkinthe.video is built **only for Sarah**.
If it doesn't help Sarah, we don't build it.
