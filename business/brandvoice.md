## 3. Brand Character (3 Words)

1. **Effortless**
   Everything should feel like magic. Paste, review, publish. Done.

2. **Honest**

## 4. Tone and Language Rules

1. **Use "you" language.**
   Right: "Paste your video link and we'll find your products."
   Wrong: "Users can paste video links..."

2. **Short and clear sentences.**
   One idea per sentence.

3. **No marketing fluff.**
   No "revolutionary", "game-changing", "AI-powered magic".
   Just say the truth: "We find products in your video."

4. **Casual but not frivolous.**
   Conversational is okay. Bro-speak or excessive emojis are not.

5. **Speak to the pain.**
   "Stop copy-pasting Amazon links."
   "Stop losing affiliate revenue."

6. **Emphasis on time saved.**
   "Hours → minutes" is our core promise.
