# The ZEN of linkinthe.video

## Core Philosophy
**[ZEN-ONE-JOB]** We do one thing well: Turn video product mentions into beautiful, monetizable product pages.
**[ZEN-EFFORTLESS]** The only real product is the feeling "That was so easy, and I'm making money". Everything serves this effortlessness.
**[ZEN-CREATOR-FIRST]** Creator > Viewer. We make Sarah's life magically easy, the rest is secondary.
**[ZEN-DATA-FREEDOM]** Your content is yours. Export anytime. No lock-in, ever.

## Boundaries
**[ZEN-NOT-SOCIAL]** We are not a social network. No feed, no follow, no likes, no comments.
**[ZEN-NOT-LINKTREE]** We are not a generic link-in-bio tool. We are video-to-product-page magic.
**[ZEN-FOCUSED]** No feature creep. We solve one problem: video product links are a pain.
**[ZEN-ONE-OUTPUT]** The only thing that matters is the single, beautiful product page.

## Fairness
**[ZEN-FAIR-TRADE]** We charge money so this place exists in 10 years — not to get rich, not for status.
**[ZEN-NO-TRAPS]** No dark patterns. No ads. No data selling. No bait-and-switch.
**[ZEN-TRANSPARENT]** Credit-based pricing. You see what you pay, you pay what you use.

## Working Style
**[ZEN-SOLO-FIT]** Every decision must be executable by one person, forever.
**[ZEN-EASIEST-PATH]** A feature is not done until the laziest possible way works perfectly.
**[ZEN-MEASURE-FIRST]** We ship with measurement. Decisions by data, never by opinion.
**[ZEN-COURAGE]** Fall in love with the problem, not the solution. Have the courage to pivot as many times as necessary.
**[ZEN-SUCCESS-READY]** Assume success. Plan for scale, security, and chaos from day one. (Lesson from onemilliondollar.link)

## Growth
**[ZEN-ORGANIC]** Growth comes from creators sharing their beautiful product pages.
**[ZEN-COLD-DM]** Our GTM is personal, 10 quality DMs per day, not spam.
**[ZEN-RETENTION]** Success = 10 people keep coming back. Retention > acquisition.

## Decision Filter (use every time)
1. Does it make video-to-product-page easier for Sarah?
2. Does it increase the "that was so easy" feeling?
3. Does it complicate the product or solo execution?
4. Can one person maintain this forever?

First two "yes" + last two "no" → ship it.
Otherwise → kill it.

## The One Rule
> **"Make the creator's video monetization effortless. Forget the rest."**

*"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add,
but when there is nothing left to take away."* — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
